LaboratoryAtHOME Nowadays if we have to check up on our body then we have to go to the clinical laboratory and give samples and then after 2-3 hours again go to the laboratory to take our reports, also in this type of pandemic situation somehow we hesitate to visit this type of places. 

To simplify this tedious process, we made an application. Through our application, people don't have to go out two times to check up on their body. Instead of that people just have to book order of whichever type of checkup they want to do from their nearest laboratory, one lab-assistant from that laboratory comes to your door to take a sample. Reports will be sent to your profile in our app, you just have to pay there and download your reports. It's worth paying some extra charge instead of visiting that laboratory two times. 

In future, we can add 

1. Awareness Blogs   - we can add tests related blogs to spread awareness in people about particular tests 
2. Real Time Tracking System - Real time tracking system in which you can track your order like zomato and amezon  
3. Scan and Upload - Where you can scan your doctors written prescription and upload so that you don't have to choose the tests, you just have to select laboratory.
